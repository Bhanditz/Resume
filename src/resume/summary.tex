\cvsection{About}

\begin{cvparagraph}

	Most recently I was a Sr. Data Engineer and Tech Lead at Chartbeat who specializes in architecting high-throughput pipelines, realtime data modeling, and leading small teams to build data-driven products. Currently I'm taking time off to travel in South America and work on my salsa dancing. I'm a strong proponent of boring but simple solutions, independent benchmarking, and sprint retrospectives.
	
	I'm seeking a senior-level engineering position focused on hard problems with the opportunity to grow into engineering leadership.
